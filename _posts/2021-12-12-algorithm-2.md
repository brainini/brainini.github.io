## Chapter 8. Polynomial Time Reductions & NP

---
          
## 1. Polynomial-Time Reductions
### Definition
- **Reduction** : Problem y is **polynomial-time reducible** to problem X if arbitrary instances of problem y can be solved using :
  - Polynomial number of standard computational steps, plus
  - Polynomial number of calls to oracle that solves problem X.
- Notation : $Y \leq _p X$
- Remarks : instances of X must be of polynomial size.
- Purpose : Classify problems according to relative difficulty
- Design algorithms : Suppose $Y \leq _p X$. If X can be solved in polynomial-time, then y can also be solved in polynomial time.
- Establish intractability : Suppose $Y \leq _p X$. If Y cannot be solved in polynomial-time, then X cannot be solved in polynomial time.
- Establish equivalence : If $Y \leq _p X$ and $X \leq _p Y$, $X \equiv _p Y$

### Reduction by equivalence
- Independent set : Given a graph G=(V, E) and an integer k, is there a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ such that $\left\vert S \right\vert \ge k$ and for each edge, at most one of its endpoints is in S?
- Vertex Cover : Given a graph G=(V, E) and an integer k, is there a subset of vertices $S \subseteq V$ such that $\left\vert S \right\vert \ge k$ and for each edge, at least one of its endpoints is in S?
- Claim : $Vertex-Cover \equiv _p Independent-Set$
- Pf : We show S is an independent set iff V - S is a vertex cover.
  - =>의 경우
    - Let S be any independent set.
    - Consider an arbitrary edge (u, v).
    - S independent => $u \notin S$ or $v \notin S$ => $u \in V-S$ or $v \in V-S$
    - Thus, V-S covers (u, v)
  - <=의 경우
    - Let V-S be any vertex cover.
    - Consider two nodes $u \in S$ and $v \in S$ 
    - Observe that $(u, v) \notin E$ since V-S is a vertex cover.
    - Thus, no two nodes in S are joined by an edge => S independent set.

### Reduction from Special to General
- Set Cover : Given a set U of elements, a collection S1, S2, ..., Sm of subsets of U, and an integer k, does there exist a collection of $\le k$ of these sets whose union is equal to U?

- Claim : Vertex-Cover $\leq _p$ Set-Cover
- Pf : Given a Vertex-Cover instance G=(V, E), k, we construct a set cover instance whose size equals the size of the vertex cover instance.

### Reduction via Gadgets
#### SAT Reduction
- Literal : Boolean variable or its negation
- Clause : A disjuction of literals ex) $C_j = x_1 \lor \bar{x_2} \lor x_3$
- conjunctive normal form : The conjunction of clauses. ex) $\Phi = C1 \land C2 \land C3$
- SAT : Given CNF formula $\Phi$, does it have a satisfying truth assignment?
- 3-SAT : SAT where each clause contains exactly **3 literals.** (2-SAT = easy to solve) <br> ex) $(x_1 \lor \bar{x_2} \lor x_3) \land (x_1 \lor x_2 \lor \bar{x_3})$

- Claim : **3-SAT $\leq _p$ Independent-Set**
- Pf : Given an instance $\Phi$ of 3-SAT, we construct an instance (G, k) of Independent-Set that has an independent set of size k iff $\Phi$ is satisfiable.
- Construction
  - G contains 3 vertices for each clause, one for each literal.
  - Connect 3 literals in a clause in a triangle.
  - Connect literal to each of its negations.





- Claim : G contains independent set of size k = $\left\vert \Phi \right\vert$ iff $\Phi$ is satisfiable.
- Pf (=>)
  - Let S be independent set of size k.
  - S must contain exactly one vertex in each triangle.
  - Set these literals to true.
  - Truth assignment is consistent and all clauses are satisfied.

- Pf (<=)
  - Given satisfying assignment, select one true literal from each triangle. This is an independent set of size k.

### Review
- Basic reduction strategies
  - Simple equivalence : Independent-Set $\equiv _p$ Vertex-Cover
  - Special case to general case : Vertex-Cover $\leq _p$ Set-Cover
  - Encoding with gadgets : 3-SAT $\leq _p$ Independent-Set
- Transitivity : If X$\leq _p$Y and Y$\leq _p$Z, then X$\leq _p$Z

- Ex: 3-SAT $\leq _p$ Independent-Set $\leq _p$ Vertex-Cover $\leq _p$ Set-Cover

## 2. Definition of NP
### Decision Problems
- Decision Problem (vs optimization)
  - X is a set of strings
  - Instance : string s
  - Algorithm A solves problem X : A(s) = yes iff s $\in$ X
- Polynomial time

### NP
- Certification algorithm intuition
  - Certifier views things from "managerial" viewpoint.
  - Certifier doesn't determine whether s $\in$ X on its own.
  - rather, it checks a proposed proof t that s $\in$ X.
- Def : Algorithm C(s, t) is a **certifier** for problem X if for every string s, s $\in$ X iff there exists a string **t(certificate)** such that C(s, t) = yes.
- NP : Decision problems for which there exists a **poly-time certifier**
  - C(s, t) is a poly-time algorithm
  - |t| $\le$ p(|s|) for some polynomial p(.)

### Certifiers and Certificates
- Composites : Given an integer s, is s composite?
  - Certificate : A nontrivial factor t of s. Note that such a certificate exists iff s is composite. Moreover **|t| $\le$ |s|** (-> polynomial)
  - Certifier (polynomial)

  ```python
  bool C(s, t) {
    if (t <= 1 || t >= s)
      return false
    else if (s is a multiple of t)
      return true
    else
      return false
  }
  ```
  - Composites is in NP

- 3-SAT
  - Certificate : An assignment of truth values to the n boolean variables
  - Certifier : Check that each clause in $\Phi$ has at least one true literal.
  - SAT is in NP

- Hamiltonian Cycle
  - HAM-Cycle : undirected graph G = (V, E), does there **exist a simple cycle C** that visits every node?
  - Certificate : A permutation of the n nodes
  - Certifier : Check that the permutation contains **each node in V exactly once**, and that **there is an edge** between each pair of adjacent nodes in the permutation
  - HAM-Cycle is in NP

### P, NP, EXP
- P : Decision problems for which there is a poly-time algorithm
- EXP : Decision problems for which there is an exponential=time algorithm.
- NP : Decision problems for which there is a poly-time certifier.

- Claim : P $\subseteq$ NP
  - Pf : Consider any problem X in P. By definition there exists a poly-time algorithm A(s) that solves X. Certificate : t = empty, certifier C(s, t) = A(s)
- Claim : NP $\subseteq$ EXP
  - Pf : Let X in NP. By definition, there exists a poly-time certifier C(s, t) for X. To solve input s, run C(s, t) on all strings t with |t| $\le$ p(|s|). Return yes, if C(s, t) returns yes for any of these.

## 3. NP-Completeness
- Polynomial Transformation : <br> Problem X polynomial transforms (Karp) to problem Y if given any input x to X, we can construct an input y such that x is a `yes` instance of X iff y is a `yes` instance of Y.

### NP-Complete
- NP-complete : A problem Y in NP with the property that for every problem X in NP, X $\leq _p$ Y. 
- Theorem : Suppose Y is an NP-complete problem. Then Y is solvable in poly-time iff P=NP
  - PF (<=) : If P=NP then Y can be solved in poly-time since Y is in NP
  - PF (=>) : Suppose Y can be solved in poly-time. Let X be any problem in NP. Let X be any problem in NP. Since X $\leq _p$ Y, we can solve X in poly-time. This implies NP $\subseteq$ P.<br> we already know P $\subseteq$ NP. Thus P = NP

The First NP-Complete Problem
- Theorem : Circuit-SAT is NP-complete (Cook, Levin)
  - algorithm that takes a fixed number of bits n as input and produces a yes/no answer can be represented by such a circuit. Moreover, if algorithm takes poly-time, then circuit is of **poly-size**.
- Pf : X in NP. It has a poly-time certifier C(s, t). To determine whether s is in X, need to know if there exists a certificate t of length p(|s|) such that C(s, t) = yes. <br> View C(s, t) as an algorithm on |s| + p(|s|) bits (input s, certificate t) and convert it into a poly-size circuit K
  - first |s| bits are hard-coded with s
  - remaining p(|s|) bits represent bits of t 

  Circuit K is satisfiable iff C(s, t) = yes.

- Remark : Once we establish first "natural" NP-complete problem, others fall like dominoes
- Recipe to establish NP-completeness of problem Y.
  1. Show that Y is in NP
  2. Choose an NP-complete problem X.
  3. Prove that X $\leq _p$ Y. <br><br>

  - Justification : If X is an NP-complete problem, and Y is a problem in NP with the property that X $\leq _p$ Y then Y is NP-complete 
    - Pf : Ley W be any problem in NP. Then W $\leq _p$ X $\leq _p$ Y.

### 3-SAT is NP-complete
- Theorem : 3-SAT is NP-complete
- Pf : Suffices to show that Circuit-SAT $\leq _p$ 3-SAT since 3-SAT is in NP. Let K be any circuit.
  - create a 3-SAT variable $x_i$ for each circuit element i. Make circuit compute correct values at each node.
  - Final step : turn clauses of length < 3 into clauses of length exactly 3.

- Observation : All problems below are NP-complete and polynomial reduce to one another!
