## 1. Load Balancing
- Definition
  - Input : m identical machines; n jobs, job j has processing time $t_j$
    - Job j must run contiguously on one machine.
    - A machine can process at most one job at a time.
  - Def : Let J(i) be the subset of jobs assigned to machine i. The load(total time) of machine i is $L_i = \sum_{j \in J(i)}{t_j}$
  - Def : The makespan is the maximum load on any machine $L = max_iL_i$
  - Load balancing : Assign each job to a machine to **minimize makespan.**

- List Scheduling algorithm
  - Consider n jobs in some fixed order.
  - Assign job j to machine whose load is smallest so far.

  ```python
    List-Scheduling(m, n, t_1, t_2, .., t_n) {
      for i = 1 to m {
        L_i = 0 # Initialize load on machine i
        J(i) = 0 # Initialize jobs assigned to machine i
      }

      for j = 1 to n {
        i = argmin(L_k) # machine i has smallest load
        J(i) = J(i) + {j} # assign job j to machine i
        L_i = L_i + t_j # update load of machine i
      }
      return J(1), ..., J(m)
    }
  ```
  - Implementation : O(nlogm) using a priority queue.

- Analysis
  - Theorem : [Graham, 1966] Greedy algorithm is a 2-approximation
    - Lemma 1 : The optimal makespan $L^* \ge max_jt_j$
      - Pf : 당연.
    - Lemma 2 : The optimal makespan $L^* \ge \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j}{t_j}$
      - Pf : One of m machines must do at least a 1/m fraction of total work.
  - Pf : Consider load $L_i$ of bottleneck machine i
    - Let j be last job scheduled on machine i
    - When job j assigned to machine i, i had smallest load. Its load before assignment is $L_i - t_j$ => $L_i - t_j \le L_k$ for all k (1 to m)
    - Sum inequalities over all k and divde by m :
    - $$L_i - t_j \le \frac{1}{m} \sum_{k}{L_k} \\ = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{k}{t_k} \\ \le L^*(lemma\;2)$$
    - Now $L_i = (L_i-t_j) + t_j \le 2L^*$ -> `2-approximation`

- Algorithm
  - Longest processing time(LPT) : Sort n jobs in descending order of processing time, and then run list scheduling algorithm.
    ```python
    LPT-List-Scheduling(m, n, t_1, t_2, .., t_n) {
      Sort jobs so that t_1 >= t_2 >= ... >= t_n

      for i = 1 to m {
        L_i = 0 # Initialize load on machine i
        J(i) = 0 # Initialize jobs assigned to machine i
      }

      for j = 1 to n {
        i = argmin(L_k) # machine i has smallest load
        J(i) = J(i) + {j} # assign job j to machine i
        L_i = L_i + t_j # update load of machine i
      }
      return J(1), ..., J(m)
    }
    ```
  - Observation : If at most m jobs, then list-scheduling is optimal.
  - Lemma 3 : If there are more than m jobs, $L^* \geq 2t_{m+1}$
    - Pf 
      - Consider first m+1 jobs $t_1 ,...,t_{m+1}$
      - Since the $t_i$'s are in descending order, each takes at least $t_{m+1}$ time.
      - There are m+1 jobs and m machines, so by pigeonhole principle, at least one machine gets two jobs.
  - Theorem : LPT rule is a 3/2 approximation algorithm
    - Pf : Some basic approach as for list scheduling
    - $L_i = (L_i-t_j) + t_j \le 2L^*$ by lemma 3

## 2. Center Selection
- Definition
  - Input : Set of n sites $s_1, ..., s_n$ and integer k > 0
  - Center selection problem : Select k centers C so that maximum distance from a site to nearest center is minimized
  - Notation
    - dist(x, y) = distance between x and y
    - dist($s_i$, C) = $min_{c \in C}dist(s_i, c)$ = distance from $s_i$ to closest center.
    - r(C) = $max_idist(s_i, C)$ = smallest covering radius
  - Goal : Find set of centers C that minimizers r(C), subject to |C| = k

- Greedy Algorithms
  - Put the first center at the best possible location for a single center, and then keep adding centers so as to reduce the covering radius time by as much as possible
  - Remark : arbitrarily bad!
  - :smile: Repeatedly choose the next center to be the site farthest from any existing center.
  ```python
    Greedy-Center-Selection(k, n, s_1, s_2, ..., s_n) {
      Select any site s
      C = {s}
      repeat k-1 times {
        Select a site s_i with maximum dist(s_i, C) # site farthest from any center
        Add s_i to C
      }
      return C
    }
  ```
  - Observation : Upon termination all centers in C are pairwise at least r(C) apart.
- Analysis
  - Theorem : Let C* be an optimal set of centers. Then $r(C) \le 2r(C^*)$ -> 2-approximation
  - Pf (by contradiction) Assume $r(C^*) < \frac{1}{2}r(C)$
    - For each site $c_i$ in C, consider ball of radius 1/2r(C) around it.
    - Exactly one $c_i^*$ in each ball; let $c_i$ be the site paired with $c_i^*$
    - consider any site s and its closest center $c_i^*$ in C*
    - $dist(s, C) \le dist(s, c_i) \le dist(s, c_i^*) + dist(c_i^*, c_i) \le 2r(C^*)$
    - Thus $r(C) \le 2r(C^*)$ -> contradiction
  - Theorem : Let C* be an optimal set of centers. Then $r(C) \le 2r(C^*)$
  - Theorem : Greedy algorithm is a 2-approximation for center selection problem
  - Remark : Greedy algorithm always places centers at sites, but is still within a factor of 2 of best solution that is allowed to place centers anywhere.

## 3. Approximation Algorithm (Using LP)
### LP Rounding : Vertex Cover
- Weighted vertex cover
- Integer Linear Programming formulation
  - Model inclusion of each vertex i using a 0/1 variable $x_i$
  - $$x_i=\begin{cases}0,\;if\;vertex \;i\;is\;not\;in\;vertex\;cover\\1,\;if\;vertex\;i\;is\;in\;vertex\;cover\end{cases}$$
  - $S = [i \in V : x_i=1]$
  - Objective function : minimize(sum($w_ix_i$))
  - Must take either i or j for edge (i, j) : $x_i+x_j \geq 1$
  - Integer_programming 
  - Observation : Vertex cover formulation proves that integer programming is NP-Complete search problem.
  - Linear programming 
    - Input : integers cj, bj, aij
    - Output : real numbers xj.
    - Simplex algorithm : can solve LP in practice(구현)
    - Ellipsoid algorithm : can solve LP in poly-time
- weighted vertex cover : LP Relaxation
  - Observation : Optimal value of (LP) is $\le$ optimal value of (ILP)
  - LP is not equivalent to vertex cover-> round fractional values 필요.
- Theorem : If x* is optimal solution to (LP), then S = {$i \in V : x^*_i \geq \frac{1}{2}$} is a vertex cover whose weight is at most twice the min possible weight -> `2-approximation`
  - Pf. [S is a vertex cover]
    - Consider an edge (i, j) $\in$ E
    - Since $x^*_i+x^*_j \geq 1$, either $x^*_i \geq \frac{1}{2}$ or $x^*_j \geq \frac{1}{2}$ => (i, j) covered.
  - Pf. [S has desired cost]
    - Let S* be optimal vertex cover. Then
    - $$\displaystyle \sum_{i \in S^*}{w_i} \geq \sum_{i \in S^*}{w_ix_i^*} \geq \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i \in S^*}{w_i}$$
